## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- how to pass props to styled components
  - was making all props optionals to avoid TypeScript errors but was only passing props to outermost component when any styled component using the prop also needed it

## Continued development

- more planning needed
  - cards not all the same at points between breakpoints (could've used grid)
  - had to add wrappers and rearrange items to get right format
